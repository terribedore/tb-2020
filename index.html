                                    <h4>Business Owner</h4>
                                        <p>I have owned + operated a few businesses over the years that span a diverse range of passions:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>taking over a side-gig dev company and turning it into a full time agency;</li>

                                                <li>figuring out the right combination of soft skills necessary to being a compassionate AND profitable landlord;</li>

                                        <p>If any of this sounds familiar (or interesting), consider becoming part of the <a href="https://geeked.design/signup">geeked family</a>!</p>
                                    <h4>Museum Curator (retired)</h4>
                                        <p>For over a decade, I worked my way up in the museum field, first as an unpaid intern and finally retiring [early!] as a curator / director in 2013. Much of my work can only be found in museums across the US; some projects personal or close to my heart, can be found on <a href="https://AlliumHouse.com/curator">Allium House: Curator Edition</a>.</p>

                                <h3>Personal</h3>
                                    <h4>Family</h4>
                                        <p>I'm a Spouse;
                                        <br>I'm a Parent of a young child;
                                        <br>I'm someone's Child;
                                        <br>I'm a Sibling;
                                        <br>I'm a Best Friend.
                                        <br><strong>Family is one of the most important words in the world.</strong> <a href="https://AlliumHouse.com">Visit</a> if you agree!</p>
                                    <h4>FI/RE</h4>
                                        <p>I was able to partially retire from working the 9-5. Now it's more like 8-12. My journey to Financial Independence and Retiring Early begins at <a href="https://AlliumHouse.com">Allium House</a>.</p>
                                    <h4>DIY'er</h4>
                                        <p>I grew up in a "Make-Do / Can-Do" household. If we didn't make do, we didn't have it. That "dive in" mentality, coupled with my curiosity has stuck. Even now, when I can afford to pay someone else to do something, I have to know *how* they do it (bonus: I know I'm not being taken for all I'm worth). My proudest moment was figuring out how to save our <a href="alliumhouse.com/coffee-grinder-fix">favorite coffee grinder</a>.</p>
